# Flask todo list

Using CMD:
set FLASK_APP=flasktodo
then I had to:
python3.10 -m flask run

then go to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in my browser

tasks can be added by entering them into the text field and committing them via hitting "Add!"
they will then instantly be added to the list
the option to remove the items is done by selecting the tick box at the end of the line and then hitting the "remove completed tasks" button
once done, these will be added to a new list of completed tasks showing what has been completed
this list of completed tasks can be cleared at any time by hitting the "clear" button below

a time is shown for when the task was completed/ removed from the list
the most recently added task is shown at the top of the page as well as the most recently deleted/completed tasks
